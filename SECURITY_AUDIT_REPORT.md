# Security Audit Report

This report summarizes the findings from a partial security and code quality audit of the Comet DevX Suite. The audit focused on non-contract components including the CLI, TypeScript SDK, Python library, Hardhat plugin, and scenario toolkit.

## Executive Summary
The audit identified several high severity issues mainly related to hard-coded secrets, insecure private key handling, and network-dependent tests. These issues have been addressed to improve the security posture of the repository.

## Detailed Findings
| Severity | Location | Description | Recommendation |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **High** | `packages/cli/src/index.ts` | Templates included example private keys. | Require users to provide keys via environment variables. |
| **High** | `packages/hardhat-comet/hardhat.config.ts` | Hard-coded Infura API key in configuration. | Load RPC URL or key from environment variables. |
| **High** | `packages/sdk/test/Comet.spec.ts` | Tests used a real RPC endpoint and private key. | Use mocked providers and dummy wallets. |
| **High** | `packages/python-sdk/src/comet_devx/comet.py` | Transaction methods relied on internal `_private_key` attribute. | Explicitly require a `private_key` parameter. |
| **Medium** | CLI argument parsing | Minimal validation of project name or template. | Add validation and helpful error messages. |
| **Medium** | Hardhat tasks | Hard-coded addresses for funding accounts. | Parameterize via environment variables. |

## Recommendations
1. Continue to store all secrets in environment variables and never commit them to source control.
2. Extend unit test coverage to scenario scripts and CLI utilities.
3. Regularly update dependencies and perform vulnerability scans (`npm audit`, `pip list --outdated`).
4. Document required environment variables in each package README.
