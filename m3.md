### What’s next in Milestone 3  
The Scenario-Simulation Toolkit needs **one more canonical example** besides the price-shock and partial-liquidation flows we already drafted:

| Scenario | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Supply / borrow happy-path** | sanity check scripts | ✅ completed (`supply-simulation.ts`) |
| **Price-shock** | show collateral value falling | ✅ completed (`price-shock.ts`) |
| **Partial liquidation** | demonstrate `absorb()` | ⏳ debugging; parked for now |
| **Interest-rate spike** | show variable borrow APR reacting to high utilisation and time-accrual | **🆕 to build** |

Interest-rate behaviour is the last item promised for Milestone 3 ( _“price shocks, partial liquidation, **rate changes**”_ in the grant plan).

## Proposed “interest-rate spike” scenario

| Step | What we’ll do | Why |
|------|---------------|-----|
| 1. Fork mainnet (as with other scripts). | Consistency. |
| 2. **Push utilisation close to 100 %**  • impersonate USDC whale(s) and borrow the remaining liquidity. | Borrow APR rises steeply as utilisation → 100 %. |
| 3. **Record base borrow rate** (`borrowRate()`) before and after. | Quantifies the spike. |
| 4. **Fast-forward time** (`hardhat_mine`) e.g. +30 days. | Lets interest accrue. |
| 5. Show borrower’s debt growing (`borrowBalanceOf`). | Demonstrates effect of high APR. |

We can implement this in a new script  
`packages/scenarios/scripts/interest-rate-spike.ts`.

### Verification plan

1. Script prints:
   * utilisation before / after,
   * borrow APR before / after,
   * debt before fast-forward / after.
2. We consider it **passed** if:
   * utilisation > 95 % after step 2,
   * borrow APR after spike > APR before spike,
   * debt after time-warp > initial debt.
