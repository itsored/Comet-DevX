# Milestone 3 Report

This milestone focused on expanding the Scenario-Simulation Toolkit and closing remaining gaps in the developer tooling.

## Completed Work
- Added a supply/borrow "happy path" scenario script (`supply-simulation.ts`).
- Implemented a price-shock scenario demonstrating collateral value drops.
- Began work on a partial liquidation scenario. Debugging is still in progress.
- Planned an interest-rate spike scenario to showcase variable borrow APR changes over time.
- Addressed high severity security issues across the CLI, Hardhat plugin, SDK tests, and Python library.

## Next Steps
- Finalize the partial liquidation script and build the interest-rate spike scenario.
- Improve input validation in CLI tooling and scenario scripts.
- Continue refining documentation and publishing examples for each scenario.
